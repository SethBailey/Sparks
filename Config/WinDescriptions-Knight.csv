With one mighty blow you, decapitated the {monster.spices},
You, split the {monster.spices} in half, in one go
You pick up a peble and using a sling shot get a direct, head shot,
You kick up so much dust that the {monster.spices}, suffocates,
You slice the {monster.spices} into a, million tiny cubes,
You chuck your weapon at the {monster.spices}, head,
You, eat, the {monster.spices}
You, karate chop, the {monster.spices} so hard that they turn to dust
You start, singing a song, so badly that the {monster.spices} dies
You punch a tree so hard that it, falls on the {monster.spices}
You sneeze on the {monster.spices} and, revolte it, to death
