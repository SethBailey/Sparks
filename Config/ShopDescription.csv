On a small cobbled path leading precisely nowhere you can see a small cottage 
The cottage has a red roof and chimney spouting rhythmic puffs of smoke 
You walk through door and are welcomed by the sound of an entrance bell and a slight whirring 
The engine sound is coming from behind a door labeled 'core' 
Above the door is a clock which makes it's presence known by the irritatingly accurate ticking 
The room it's self is comfortably full and completely wooden 
To the left of the room there are two hallways the first is labeled L1 the second is L2 
On the right side of the room the third hallway L3, at this point the shop keeper walks in 
The first thing you notice is her pink hair, and while creping an eye on the clock she stands behind her desk
