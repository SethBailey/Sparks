You walk through the door to find a small waiting room complete with stools and a bench
But you are not here to wait so you knock on the door at the end of the room ... and get no reply
You open the door and see three training dummeys stood on the foam floor
The floor is covered in lines and markings that would only mean something to the most astute black belt
In the corner of the room you can see the sensei talking to a hooded figure out the window
The sensei looks mildly concerned but not unkind at this piont he spots you and wraps things up
