Reality melts and you start to fall... you hear an engine 

You find your self standing in front of a large building with an old wooden door.
You walk through the door to find a small waiting room complete with stools and a bench
But you are not here to wait so you knock on the door at the end of the room ... and get no reply
You open the door and see three training dummies stood on the foam floor
The floor is covered in lines and markings that would only mean something to the most astute black belt
In the corner of the room you can see the sansei talking to a hooded figure out the window
The sansei looks mildly concerned but not unkind at this point he spots you and wraps things up
