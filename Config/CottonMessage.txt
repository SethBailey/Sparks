The room is disturbingly clean and white and lined with safes, like in a bank vault.
As you enthusiastically scan the room you notice a worrying lake of any prisoners or princesses.
You feel a oppressive chill down your spine as Sparks silently materializes himself a body.
However just before he could make it through the door a wall of fire erupted in front of the passage.

This all passed in such a rush that these fore points are all you can remember as you sit up with 
a splitting headache and take in the room you now in ... mmm nothing as far as the eye can see; pitch black.
You sit there for what feel's like hours mulling over what happened until you hear you foot-steps from behind,
not knowing what to expect you turn around sharply and see the familiar face of Cotton.
She asks you stay seated and hold your questions, she has some explaining to do.

"So, having a good day?" ... "well I'll just get to it then: My full name is Cotton CPU"
"I am, to put it bluntly, the manager of this world / computer, and you and I have a problem" 
you start trying to ask questions, but quickly get hushed down "look we have a virus on our hands
and if we don't sort it out han this world is going down like the anti-virus who you just shut down"
You manage to slip in a question about the mage and Kafe "The 'mage' was Michael the anti-virus, 
don't worry it will take more than that to kill him but he has been stalled. Oh and Kafe was fake
all along."

"Now to fix all of this we just have to find the file containing the virus which is somewhere in memory.
I asked my friend William Memory to try and find it but he hasn't gotten back to me, (I suspect the virus is holding him)
so it's up to you." You start to try ask something but again get silenced "I'm sending you into memory to find this file 
and destroy it I think I can stall the virus for 10 days which should be plenty of time, well good luck"
