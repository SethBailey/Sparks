The hole world go's squint you are back in the dark room with Cotton and someone else
Cotton: "You did it!  I knew you would, never doubted you "
Stranger: "Well I did, especially after you tried to do me in, what wasn't clear about me 
asking you to stop"
Cotton: "Michael stop being so moody you survived didn't you"
Cotton explains that Sparks tried to make shure that you didn't wise up to the roose
by turning Michael's warning black.
Cotton :"I tried to get around this problem by using sound instead, clever huh"
Michael :"still you owe me an apology user"
you apologize profusely
Michael :"Right uhh well good and umm thank you"
Cotton :"That was painful, and by the way William has been taking good care of the dojo,
but get this; earlier I had to fish him out of the void and I asked if it was the
virus but he said he didn't want to talk about it"
Michael :"I'll talk to him later, but user what are you going to do now, you could work in my dojo."
Cotton :"Or you could help me out in the shop."
You say that you are not shure and that you will have to think it over.

1 year later

Cotton's shop and Michael's merge to create the flame academy so you get to 
have the best of both worlds.
You never forgot about Sparks and even wrote a book on the matter of viruses.
And I don't think anyone could of wanted a happier ending.
