Testing, testing, 123  this is Sparks talking.
I suppose ten days just didn't cut it hay, ay well don't be
disheartened you gave it a good try, and every one knows you can't 
really kill a user especially with Cotton always fishing you out of the void
and bringing you back into the program still, it was fun.
I would like you to know that it was nothing personal and I even grew to 
respect your skills and perseverance, they reminded me of myself.
And yes I know that you as the user have the ability to restart but 
I don't think that even you would go that far, you lost, except that you 
are not perfect but even so. 

Better luck next time.
